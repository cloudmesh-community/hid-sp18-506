Ethereum is an open-source, public, 
distributed computing that ``runs
smart contracts: applications that 
run exactly as programmed without
any possibility of downtime, censorship, 
fraud or third-party
interference``~\cite{hid-sp18-506-EthereumOrg}.

A smart contract is a computer protocol 
intended to digitally
facilitate, verify, or enforce the 
negotiation or performance of a
contract without third parties which 
means there is no need for
\emph{middlemen} like lawyers or 
notaries. In theory, this means that
you can carry out transactions 
without the waiting times inherent to
paper filings, and without paying 
fees to whoever would typically
oversee such a transaction. 
This is particularly important 
for people living in countries 
where the legal system is corrupt, 
or woefully inefficient. 
These transactions are trackable and irreversible.

Although smart contract technology 
is still a very new, it has a wide
range of potential applications 
like as voting, global supply chains,
medical records, the financial system. 
It is very promising it is
believed that its full potential 
has yet to be discovered.
