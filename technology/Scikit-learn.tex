A Google Summer of Code project, scikit-learn project is a machine-learning library.  Written in Python, it is designed to be simple and efficient, accessible to non-experts, and reusable in various contexts. Its goal is to provide a set of common algorithms to Python users through a consistent interface.

This package focuses on bringing machine learning to non-specialists using a general-purpose high-level language that is easy to follow. “Emphasis is put on ease of use, performance, documentation, and API consistency. It has minimal dependencies and is distributed under the simplified BSD license, encouraging its use in both academic and commercial settings. Source code, binaries, and documentation can be downloaded from http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net.” \cite{hid-sp18-506-Scikit-learn}
